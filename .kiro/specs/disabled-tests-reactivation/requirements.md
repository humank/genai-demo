# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for reactivating disabled end-to-end integration tests that were disabled due to TestRestTemplate dependency issues. The tests were disabled because of HttpComponents dependency conflicts that caused NoClassDefFoundError and other runtime issues during test execution.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Identify and Analyze Disabled Tests

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to understand which tests are currently disabled and why, so that I can systematically address the underlying issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing the codebase THEN the system SHALL identify all tests marked with @Disabled annotation
2. WHEN examining disabled tests THEN the system SHALL categorize the reasons for disabling (TestRestTemplate issues, dependency conflicts, etc.)
3. WHEN reviewing test configurations THEN the system SHALL document the current HTTP client configuration attempts
4. IF multiple test configuration classes exist THEN the system SHALL identify conflicts and redundancies

### Requirement 2: Resolve TestRestTemplate Dependency Issues

**User Story:** As a developer, I want TestRestTemplate to work reliably in integration tests, so that end-to-end tests can validate the complete application functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running integration tests THEN TestRestTemplate SHALL be properly configured without NoClassDefFoundError
2. WHEN using TestRestTemplate THEN HTTP client dependencies SHALL be resolved consistently
3. WHEN tests execute THEN there SHALL be no conflicts between different HTTP client implementations
4. IF HttpComponents dependencies are required THEN they SHALL be properly included and configured
5. WHEN test configuration is applied THEN it SHALL override production HTTP client settings appropriately

### Requirement 3: Standardize Test HTTP Client Configuration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a unified and reliable HTTP client configuration for tests, so that all integration tests use consistent and working HTTP clients.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring test HTTP clients THEN there SHALL be a single, authoritative configuration
2. WHEN tests run THEN they SHALL use SimpleClientHttpRequestFactory as the primary HTTP client factory
3. WHEN HttpComponents is needed THEN it SHALL be properly configured with correct versions
4. IF test profiles are active THEN HTTP client configuration SHALL be optimized for test environments
5. WHEN multiple test types run THEN they SHALL share the same HTTP client configuration

### Requirement 4: Re-enable End-to-End Integration Tests

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the disabled end-to-end integration tests to run successfully, so that I can validate complete system functionality and observability features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN SimpleEndToEndValidationTest runs THEN it SHALL pass all health endpoint validations
2. WHEN EndToEndIntegrationTest runs THEN it SHALL validate observability integration completely
3. WHEN tests execute THEN they SHALL verify metrics endpoints, tracing, and health checks
4. IF tests fail THEN they SHALL provide clear error messages for debugging
5. WHEN all integration tests complete THEN they SHALL provide comprehensive validation reports

### Requirement 5: Optimize Test Performance and Reliability

**User Story:** As a developer, I want integration tests to run efficiently and reliably, so that they can be included in regular CI/CD pipelines without causing delays or flaky failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integration tests run THEN they SHALL complete within reasonable time limits (< 30 seconds per test)
2. WHEN tests execute concurrently THEN they SHALL not interfere with each other
3. WHEN test resources are allocated THEN memory usage SHALL be optimized to prevent OutOfMemoryError
4. IF tests fail THEN they SHALL be retryable and provide consistent results
5. WHEN test cleanup occurs THEN resources SHALL be properly released

### Requirement 6: Validate Observability Features

**User Story:** As a developer, I want integration tests to thoroughly validate observability features, so that monitoring, tracing, and metrics collection work correctly in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN observability tests run THEN they SHALL validate structured logging functionality
2. WHEN metrics tests execute THEN they SHALL verify Prometheus metrics endpoint accessibility
3. WHEN tracing tests run THEN they SHALL validate distributed tracing configuration
4. WHEN health check tests execute THEN they SHALL verify all health indicators
5. IF observability features fail THEN tests SHALL provide detailed diagnostic information

### Requirement 7: Ensure Test Environment Isolation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want test environments to be properly isolated from production configurations, so that tests run consistently regardless of the deployment environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN test profiles are active THEN production-specific configurations SHALL be overridden
2. WHEN tests run THEN they SHALL use in-memory databases and mock external services
3. WHEN test configurations load THEN they SHALL not conflict with production beans
4. IF external dependencies are required THEN they SHALL be mocked or stubbed appropriately
5. WHEN tests complete THEN they SHALL clean up all test-specific resources

### Requirement 8: Provide Comprehensive Test Documentation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear documentation on test configuration and execution, so that I can understand how to run and maintain the integration tests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN test documentation is created THEN it SHALL explain the HTTP client configuration strategy
2. WHEN troubleshooting guides are written THEN they SHALL address common TestRestTemplate issues
3. WHEN test execution instructions are provided THEN they SHALL include different test categories
4. IF configuration changes are made THEN documentation SHALL be updated accordingly
5. WHEN new developers join THEN they SHALL be able to run tests successfully using the documentation
