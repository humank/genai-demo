# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for systematically reactivating 55 disabled tests across multiple categories. Based on comprehensive analysis, tests were disabled due to various issues including TestRestTemplate dependency conflicts, Spring Profile configuration problems, Bean definition conflicts, memory constraints, and environment-specific functionality that doesn't apply to test environments. This spec addresses all categories of disabled tests to restore comprehensive test coverage.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Comprehensive Disabled Test Analysis and Categorization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to understand all 55 disabled tests across different categories, so that I can systematically address each type of issue with appropriate solutions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing the codebase THEN the system SHALL identify all tests marked with @org.junit.jupiter.api.Disabled annotation
2. WHEN categorizing disabled tests THEN the system SHALL group them by issue type: Configuration Issues (Profile conflicts, Bean conflicts), Dependency Issues (HTTP Client, AspectJ), Resource Constraints (Memory, Timeout), Environment-Specific Features (Kubernetes probes, Production-only features)
3. WHEN examining test failure patterns THEN the system SHALL document specific error messages and root causes for each category
4. WHEN prioritizing fixes THEN the system SHALL rank issues by impact on core functionality and ease of resolution
5. IF tests are disabled for valid reasons THEN the system SHALL document whether they should remain disabled or be replaced with alternative tests

### Requirement 2: Resolve Spring Profile Configuration Issues

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Spring Profile configurations to work correctly in test environments, so that profile-specific tests can validate environment-specific functionality without conflicts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ProfileActivationIntegrationTest runs THEN it SHALL properly activate test profiles without Bean definition conflicts
2. WHEN DevelopmentProfileTest executes THEN it SHALL configure H2 database settings without interfering with other tests
3. WHEN multiple profiles are active THEN they SHALL not create conflicting Bean definitions
4. WHEN test-specific properties are loaded THEN they SHALL override production configurations appropriately
5. IF profile configuration fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages indicating the specific conflict source

### Requirement 3: Fix HTTP Client and TestRestTemplate Dependencies

**User Story:** As a developer, I want TestRestTemplate and HTTP client dependencies to work reliably, so that integration tests can make HTTP requests without NoClassDefFoundError or dependency conflicts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running integration tests THEN TestRestTemplate SHALL be properly configured without NoClassDefFoundError
2. WHEN HTTP client dependencies are resolved THEN there SHALL be no conflicts between HttpComponents versions
3. WHEN tests execute HTTP requests THEN they SHALL use consistent HTTP client implementations
4. WHEN test configurations load THEN they SHALL not conflict with production HTTP client settings
5. IF HttpComponents dependencies are required THEN they SHALL be properly included with compatible versions

### Requirement 4: Resolve Bean Definition Conflicts and Configuration Issues

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to eliminate Bean definition conflicts and configuration issues, so that tests can run without Spring context loading failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN HealthCheckIntegrationTest loads THEN it SHALL not have Bean definition conflicts with other configurations
2. WHEN TracingWebIntegrationTest runs THEN it SHALL load Spring context without Bean conflicts
3. WHEN multiple test configurations are present THEN they SHALL use proper @ConditionalOn annotations to avoid conflicts
4. WHEN test contexts are loaded THEN they SHALL use appropriate @TestConfiguration classes with proper scoping
5. IF Bean conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages indicating which Beans are conflicting

### Requirement 5: Address Memory and Resource Constraint Issues

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to resolve memory and resource constraint issues, so that tests can run reliably without OutOfMemoryError or timeout failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN memory-intensive tests run THEN they SHALL not exceed available heap memory limits
2. WHEN Prometheus metrics tests execute THEN they SHALL complete without memory exhaustion
3. WHEN test JVM parameters are configured THEN they SHALL provide adequate memory for test execution
4. WHEN test cleanup occurs THEN resources SHALL be properly released to prevent memory leaks
5. IF memory issues persist THEN tests SHALL be refactored to use lighter-weight alternatives or mocking

### Requirement 6: Handle Environment-Specific and Non-Core Feature Tests

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to properly handle tests for environment-specific features and non-core functionality, so that they either run appropriately in test environments or are replaced with suitable alternatives.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Kubernetes probe tests are encountered THEN they SHALL either be adapted for test environments or remain disabled with clear documentation
2. WHEN Swagger UI functionality tests run THEN they SHALL be enabled only when OpenAPI features are core requirements
3. WHEN production-specific features are tested THEN they SHALL use appropriate mocks or test doubles
4. WHEN environment-specific tests are disabled THEN they SHALL have clear documentation explaining the rationale
5. IF non-core features need testing THEN lightweight alternatives SHALL be implemented that don't require full production setup

### Requirement 7: Reactivate Core Integration and Observability Tests

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to reactivate the most important disabled tests that validate core system functionality, so that critical features have proper test coverage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN EndToEndIntegrationTest is reactivated THEN it SHALL validate complete system functionality without configuration conflicts
2. WHEN BasicObservabilityValidationTest runs THEN it SHALL verify logging, metrics, and tracing features
3. WHEN HealthCheckIntegrationTest executes THEN it SHALL validate all health indicators and actuator endpoints
4. WHEN observability tests run THEN they SHALL provide comprehensive validation of monitoring features
5. IF core tests cannot be reactivated THEN equivalent lightweight tests SHALL be created to maintain coverage

### Requirement 8: Implement Systematic Test Reactivation Strategy

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a systematic approach to reactivating disabled tests, so that I can prioritize fixes based on impact and complexity while maintaining system stability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing fixes THEN they SHALL be prioritized by: Core functionality impact (High), Configuration complexity (Medium), Environment-specific features (Low)
2. WHEN reactivating tests THEN each category SHALL be addressed with appropriate solutions: Profile fixes for configuration issues, Dependency resolution for HTTP client issues, Resource optimization for memory issues, Documentation for environment-specific features
3. WHEN tests are reactivated THEN they SHALL be validated individually before enabling in the full test suite
4. WHEN fixes are implemented THEN they SHALL not break existing working tests
5. IF some tests cannot be reactivated THEN clear documentation SHALL explain the rationale and any alternative testing approaches
