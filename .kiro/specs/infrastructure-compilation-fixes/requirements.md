# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses the compilation errors in the AWS CDK infrastructure code that are preventing successful builds. The errors span multiple stack files and include missing imports, interface mismatches, and deprecated module references.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the CDK infrastructure code to compile successfully, so that I can deploy and test the infrastructure stacks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run `npm run build` in the infrastructure directory THEN the TypeScript compilation SHALL complete without errors
2. WHEN I run CDK commands THEN they SHALL execute without TypeScript compilation failures
3. WHEN I import stack classes THEN all required dependencies SHALL be properly resolved

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper TypeScript imports and exports, so that all stack dependencies are correctly resolved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN MSKStack is imported THEN it SHALL be properly exported from the stacks index file
2. WHEN AnalyticsStack is imported THEN it SHALL be properly exported from the stacks index file
3. WHEN KMS namespace is used THEN it SHALL be properly imported from aws-cdk-lib
4. WHEN OpenSearch is used THEN it SHALL use the correct CDK v2 import path

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want ObservabilityStack interface to match its usage, so that all properties are properly exposed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ObservabilityStackProps is used THEN it SHALL include the projectName property
2. WHEN ObservabilityStack is instantiated THEN it SHALL expose all required public properties
3. WHEN other stacks reference ObservabilityStack properties THEN they SHALL be properly typed and accessible

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want deprecated CDK constructs to be updated, so that the code uses current best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using CloudWatch Logs destinations THEN it SHALL use the current CDK v2 API
2. WHEN using OpenSearch THEN it SHALL use the correct aws-opensearchserverless import if needed
3. WHEN using Lambda destinations THEN it SHALL use the proper construct classes

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all stack tests to pass, so that I can verify the infrastructure configuration is correct.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run `npm test` THEN all ObservabilityStack tests SHALL pass
2. WHEN I run tests THEN there SHALL be no TypeScript compilation errors in test files
3. WHEN tests reference stack properties THEN they SHALL match the actual stack interface

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent error handling across all infrastructure stacks, so that deployment failures are properly managed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a stack deployment fails THEN error messages SHALL be clear and actionable
2. WHEN dependencies are missing THEN the error SHALL indicate which imports are needed
3. WHEN interface mismatches occur THEN the error SHALL specify the expected vs actual types
