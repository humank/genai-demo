# Requirements Document

## Introduction

修復 Profile Configuration 驗證邏輯，使其支援測試環境的 `test` profile，解決當前測試失敗的問題。系統目前只允許 `dev`、`production` 和 `openapi` profiles，但測試框架需要使用 `test` profile。

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to support test profile during testing, so that all tests can run successfully without profile validation errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts with "test" profile THEN the system SHALL accept it as a valid profile
2. WHEN running unit tests or integration tests THEN the profile validation SHALL NOT throw IllegalStateException for "test" profile
3. WHEN "test" profile is active THEN the system SHALL configure appropriate test-specific settings

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear profile validation rules, so that I understand which profiles are supported in different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN profile validation occurs THEN the system SHALL support ["dev", "production", "test", "openapi"] profiles
2. WHEN an invalid profile is used THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages listing valid profiles
3. WHEN multiple profiles are active THEN the system SHALL validate each profile individually

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want test-specific configuration, so that tests run with appropriate settings without affecting other environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN "test" profile is active THEN the system SHALL use in-memory database configuration
2. WHEN "test" profile is active THEN the system SHALL disable external service integrations
3. WHEN "test" profile is active THEN the system SHALL use test-specific logging configuration

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want profile detection methods, so that I can conditionally configure beans based on the active profile.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN checking for test profile THEN the system SHALL provide isTestProfile() method
2. WHEN test profile is active THEN isTestProfile() SHALL return true
3. WHEN other profiles are active THEN isTestProfile() SHALL return false
