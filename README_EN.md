### ⚡ Performance Optimization Technologies

#### Test Performance Monitoring Framework

**TestPerformanceExtension** provides automated test performance monitoring:

- **⏱️ Execution Time Tracking**: Millisecond-precision test execution time monitoring
- **💾 Memory Usage Monitoring**: Heap memory usage tracking before and after tests
- **📊 Performance Regression Detection**: Automatic detection of performance degradation with configurable thresholds
- **📈 Detailed Report Generation**: Text and HTML format performance analysis reports
- **🐌 Slow Test Identification**: Automatic flagging of tests exceeding 5 seconds
- **🧹 Resource Management**: Automatic cleanup of test resources to prevent memory leaks

```java
// Usage example
@TestPerformanceExtension(maxExecutionTimeMs = 10000, maxMemoryIncreaseMB = 100)
@IntegrationTest
public class MyIntegrationTest extends BaseIntegrationTest {
    // Test methods are automatically monitored for performance
}
```

**Performance Report Location**: `build/reports/test-performance/`

#### Three-Stage Profile Architecture

**Simplified and Practical Environment Management Strategy**:

- **🏠 Local Profile**: Local development environment (H2 + Redis + in-memory events)
- **🎭 Staging Profile**: AWS pre-production environment (RDS + ElastiCache + MSK)
- **🚀 Production Profile**: AWS production environment (RDS Multi-AZ + ElastiCache Cluster + MSK Multi-AZ)

```bash
# Local development
export SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=local
./gradlew bootRun

# Test execution (automatically uses test profile)
./gradlew test

# AWS deployment
export SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=staging    # or production
```

**Complete Configuration Guide**: [Profile Management Strategy](docs/viewpoints/development/profile-management.md)

#### System Optimization Configuration

```bash
# Test optimization demonstration (recommended) - showcases test performance optimization results
./scripts/run-optimized-tests.sh

# Optimized compilation (reduced log output, increased memory)
./scripts/build-optimized.sh

# Optimized test execution (only shows error logs)
./scripts/run-tests-optimized.sh

# Memory usage monitoring
./scripts/monitor-memory.sh

# System resource check
./scripts/check-system-resources.sh
```

**Optimization Results**:
- **Memory Configuration**: Compilation and test maximum heap memory increased to 4GB
- **Log Optimization**: Only ERROR level logs output during testing, significantly reducing output volume
- **JVM Optimization**: Using G1 garbage collector and string deduplication optimization
- **Parallel Processing**: Optimized Gradle parallel execution configuration

### 🏗️ Architecture Design

#### Hexagonal Architecture + DDD Layering

```
interfaces/ → application/ → domain/ ← infrastructure/
```

- **Domain Layer**: Business logic + aggregate roots + value objects + domain events + specification pattern
- **Application Layer**: Use case coordination + event publishing + cross-aggregate operations
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Persistence + external systems + event handling
- **Interface Layer**: REST API + OpenAPI 3.0 + Swagger UI
