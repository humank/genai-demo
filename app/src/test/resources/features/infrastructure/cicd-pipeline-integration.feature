Feature: CI/CD Pipeline Integration Testing
  As a DevOps engineer
  I want to validate CI/CD pipeline with real deployments
  So that I can ensure reliable and automated software delivery

  Background:
    Given the CI/CD pipeline is configured with GitHub Actions and ArgoCD
    And the GitOps repository is properly set up

  @cicd @github-actions @build
  Scenario: GitHub Actions CI pipeline validation
    Given code changes are pushed to the main branch
    When GitHub Actions CI pipeline is triggered
    Then unit tests should execute and pass
    And integration tests should execute and pass
    And BDD tests should execute and pass
    And architecture tests should validate DDD compliance
    And security scanning should complete without critical vulnerabilities
    And test coverage should meet minimum thresholds (>80%)
    And build artifacts should be generated successfully

  @cicd @docker @multi-arch
  Scenario: Multi-architecture Docker image build and push
    Given the CI pipeline has completed successfully
    When Docker image build process starts
    Then multi-architecture images should be built for ARM64 Graviton3
    And images should be optimized for production deployment
    And security scanning should validate container images
    And images should be tagged with commit SHA and semantic version
    And images should be pushed to Amazon ECR successfully
    And image metadata should include build information and dependencies

  @cicd @argocd @gitops
  Scenario: ArgoCD GitOps deployment validation
    Given new container images are available in ECR
    And GitOps repository is updated with new image tags
    When ArgoCD detects configuration changes
    Then ArgoCD should sync changes to EKS cluster automatically
    And deployment should use Blue-Green strategy for backend services
    And deployment should use Canary strategy for frontend services
    And health checks should validate successful deployment
    And rollback should be triggered if health checks fail

  @cicd @ssl @certificates
  Scenario: SSL certificate and domain configuration validation
    Given SSL certificates are configured for kimkao.io domain
    When applications are deployed through CI/CD pipeline
    Then HTTPS endpoints should be accessible via kimkao.io subdomains
    And SSL certificates should be valid and properly configured
    And HTTP traffic should be redirected to HTTPS automatically
    And certificate renewal should be automated and monitored
    And security headers should be properly configured

  @cicd @secrets @security
  Scenario: Secure secret management in CI/CD pipeline
    Given secrets are managed through AWS Secrets Manager
    When CI/CD pipeline accesses secrets
    Then secrets should never be logged or exposed in build outputs
    And IAM roles should enforce least privilege access to secrets
    And secret rotation should not break the deployment pipeline
    And audit trails should track all secret access
    And secrets should be encrypted in transit and at rest

  @cicd @quality-gates @validation
  Scenario: Quality gates and deployment validation
    Given quality gates are configured in the CI/CD pipeline
    When deployment validation occurs
    Then code quality metrics should meet defined thresholds
    And security vulnerabilities should be below acceptable levels
    And performance benchmarks should be validated
    And API contract tests should pass
    And database migration tests should succeed
    And infrastructure compliance should be verified

  @cicd @monitoring @observability
  Scenario: CI/CD pipeline monitoring and observability
    Given pipeline monitoring is configured
    When CI/CD pipeline executes
    Then pipeline execution metrics should be collected and visualized
    And build duration should be tracked and optimized
    And deployment success/failure rates should be monitored
    And pipeline bottlenecks should be identified and reported
    And alerting should notify teams of pipeline failures
    And deployment correlation with system metrics should be available

  @cicd @rollback @recovery
  Scenario: Automated rollback and recovery procedures
    Given automated rollback is configured based on health metrics
    When deployment causes system degradation
    Then health metrics should detect the degradation automatically
    And automated rollback should be triggered within defined timeframes
    And previous stable version should be restored successfully
    And system health should be validated after rollback
    And incident should be logged and stakeholders notified
    And root cause analysis should be initiated automatically

  @cicd @environment @promotion
  Scenario: Environment promotion and validation
    Given multiple environments are configured (dev, staging, production)
    When code changes are promoted through environments
    Then development environment should be deployed first
    And automated testing should validate development deployment
    And staging environment should receive promoted changes
    And production-like testing should be performed in staging
    And production deployment should occur only after staging validation
    And each environment should maintain appropriate configurations

  @cicd @performance @load-testing
  Scenario: Automated performance and load testing in CI/CD
    Given performance testing is integrated into the pipeline
    When deployment to staging environment completes
    Then automated load tests should be executed
    And performance benchmarks should be validated
    And resource utilization should be monitored during tests
    And performance regression should prevent production deployment
    And load test results should be archived and analyzed
    And performance trends should be tracked over time

  @cicd @compliance @audit
  Scenario: Compliance and audit trail in CI/CD pipeline
    Given compliance requirements are enforced in CI/CD
    When pipeline executes
    Then all pipeline activities should be logged and auditable
    And code changes should be traceable to requirements
    And deployment approvals should be documented where required
    And security scans should be performed and results archived
    And compliance violations should prevent deployment progression
    And audit reports should be generated automatically

  @cicd @notification @communication
  Scenario: Pipeline notification and communication
    Given notification systems are configured
    When pipeline events occur
    Then build status should be communicated to development teams
    And deployment notifications should be sent to stakeholders
    And failure notifications should include diagnostic information
    And Success notifications should include deployment details
    And Escalation should occur for repeated failures
    And Status dashboards should provide real-time pipeline visibility
