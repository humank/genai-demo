Feature: Disaster Recovery Integration Testing
  As a reliability engineer
  I want to validate disaster recovery procedures and failover scenarios
  So that I can ensure business continuity with minimal downtime and data loss

  Background:
    Given the multi-region disaster recovery system is configured
    And primary region is Taiwan (ap-east-2)
    And secondary region is Tokyo (ap-northeast-1)

  @disaster-recovery @failover @database
  Scenario: Aurora Global Database automated failover
    Given Aurora Global Database is configured across regions
    And data replication is active and healthy
    When primary region becomes unavailable
    Then Aurora Global Database should automatically promote secondary region
    And database connectivity should be restored within 60 seconds
    And zero data loss should be achieved (RPO = 0)
    And application should reconnect to new primary database
    And replication should resume when primary region recovers

  @disaster-recovery @dns @routing
  Scenario: Route 53 health checks and DNS failover
    Given Route 53 health checks are monitoring both regions
    And latency-based routing is configured with Taiwan preference
    When primary region health checks fail
    Then Route 53 should automatically route traffic to secondary region
    And DNS propagation should complete within 60 seconds
    And users should experience minimal service interruption
    And health check recovery should restore primary region routing

  @disaster-recovery @messaging @replication
  Scenario: MSK cross-region data replication and failover
    Given MSK clusters are configured in both regions
    And MirrorMaker 2.0 is replicating data bidirectionally
    When primary region MSK becomes unavailable
    Then applications should failover to secondary region MSK
    And event processing should continue with minimal delay
    And data consistency should be maintained across regions
    And replication should resume when primary region recovers

  @disaster-recovery @observability @monitoring
  Scenario: Cross-region observability during disaster recovery
    Given observability data is replicated across regions
    When disaster recovery is activated
    Then monitoring should remain operational in secondary region
    And historical data should be accessible for analysis
    And alerting should continue to function normally
    And log aggregation should provide unified view across regions
    And metrics collection should maintain continuity

  @disaster-recovery @automation @procedures
  Scenario: Automated disaster recovery procedures
    Given disaster recovery automation is configured
    When regional failure is detected
    Then automated failover procedures should be triggered
    And stakeholders should be notified of DR activation
    And system status should be updated automatically
    And recovery progress should be tracked and reported
    And rollback procedures should be available if needed

  @disaster-recovery @testing @validation
  Scenario: Monthly disaster recovery testing
    Given disaster recovery testing is scheduled monthly
    When DR test is initiated
    Then simulated regional failure should trigger failover procedures
    And RTO (Recovery Time Objective) should be measured and validated
    And RPO (Recovery Point Objective) should be verified
    And all critical services should be operational in secondary region
    And test results should be documented and analyzed
    And improvements should be identified and implemented

  @disaster-recovery @data-consistency @integrity
  Scenario: Data consistency validation during failover
    Given data is being actively written to primary region
    When failover occurs during active transactions
    Then data integrity should be maintained across regions
    And no transactions should be lost or corrupted
    And eventual consistency should be achieved within defined timeframes
    And data validation checks should pass after failover
    And audit trails should remain complete and accurate

  @disaster-recovery @application @resilience
  Scenario: Application resilience during regional failures
    Given applications are deployed in both regions
    When primary region becomes unavailable
    Then applications should automatically connect to secondary region resources
    And user sessions should be maintained where possible
    And application state should be preserved or gracefully recovered
    And performance should remain within acceptable limits
    And error rates should not exceed defined thresholds

  @disaster-recovery @network @connectivity
  Scenario: Cross-region network connectivity and security
    Given VPC peering is configured between regions
    When disaster recovery is activated
    Then network connectivity should be maintained between regions
    And security groups should allow necessary cross-region traffic
    And encryption should be maintained for all data in transit
    And network performance should meet application requirements
    And firewall rules should remain properly configured

  @disaster-recovery @compliance @audit
  Scenario: Compliance and audit during disaster recovery
    Given compliance requirements must be maintained during DR
    When disaster recovery procedures are executed
    Then all DR activities should be logged and auditable
    And compliance controls should remain active in secondary region
    And regulatory requirements should continue to be met
    And audit trails should be preserved across regions
    And compliance reports should reflect DR status accurately

  @disaster-recovery @communication @stakeholders
  Scenario: Stakeholder communication during disaster recovery
    Given communication procedures are defined for DR events
    When disaster recovery is activated
    Then automated notifications should be sent to stakeholders
    And status updates should be provided at regular intervals
    And communication channels should remain operational
    And escalation procedures should be followed for extended outages
    And post-incident communication should summarize impact and resolution

  @disaster-recovery @performance @sla
  Scenario: Performance and SLA maintenance during disaster recovery
    Given SLA requirements are defined for disaster recovery scenarios
    When operating in disaster recovery mode
    Then system performance should meet defined SLA targets
    And response times should remain within acceptable limits
    And throughput should support critical business operations
    And availability should be maintained above SLA thresholds
    And performance metrics should be continuously monitored and reported
