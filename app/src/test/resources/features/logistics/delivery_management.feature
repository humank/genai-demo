  As a customer
  I want to track the delivery status of my order
  So that I know when I will receive my products

  Background:
    # 假設我已經創建了一個訂單
    # 並且我已經成功支付了訂單
    # 並且訂單狀態為 "已確認"
    Given I have created an order
    And I have successfully paid for the order
    And the order status is "CONFIRMED"

  Scenario: Successfully arrange delivery
    # 當系統安排配送
    # 並且物流系統建立配送單
    # 那麼配送狀態應該更新為 "待發貨"
    # 並且我應該收到配送安排的通知
    # 並且通知應該包含預計配送時間
    When the system arranges delivery
    And the logistics system creates a delivery order
    Then the delivery status should be updated to "PENDING_SHIPMENT"
    And I should receive a delivery arrangement notification
    And the notification should include estimated delivery time

  Scenario: Delivery resource allocation
    # 假設物流系統已建立配送單
    # 當物流系統分配配送資源
    # 並且配送員接受配送任務
    # 那麼配送狀態應該更新為 "配送中"
    # 並且我應該能夠查看配送員信息
    # 並且我應該能夠追蹤配送實時位置
    Given the logistics system has created a delivery order
    When the logistics system allocates delivery resources
    And the delivery person accepts the delivery task
    Then the delivery status should be updated to "IN_TRANSIT"
    And I should be able to view delivery person information
    And I should be able to track the delivery real-time location

  Scenario: Successfully complete delivery
    # 假設配送狀態為 "配送中"
    # 當配送員送達商品
    # 並且我簽收商品
    # 那麼配送狀態應該更新為 "已送達"
    # 並且訂單狀態應該更新為 "已完成"
    # 並且我應該收到配送完成的通知
    Given the delivery status is "IN_TRANSIT"
    When the delivery person delivers the products
    And I sign for the products
    Then the delivery status should be updated to "DELIVERED"
    And the order status should be updated to "COMPLETED"
    And I should receive a delivery completion notification

  Scenario: Delivery delay
    # 假設配送狀態為 "配送中"
    # 當配送過程中遇到延遲
    # 並且配送員更新延遲原因
    # 那麼配送狀態應該更新為 "延遲"
    # 並且我應該收到配送延遲的通知
    # 並且通知應該包含延遲原因和新的預計送達時間
    Given the delivery status is "IN_TRANSIT"
    When there is a delay during delivery
    And the delivery person updates the delay reason
    Then the delivery status should be updated to "DELAYED"
    And I should receive a delivery delay notification
    And the notification should include the delay reason and new estimated delivery time

  Scenario: Update delivery address
    # 假設配送狀態為 "待發貨"
    # 當我請求更新配送地址
    # 並且我提供新的有效地址
    # 那麼系統應該更新配送地址
    # 並且物流系統應該更新配送單信息
    # 並且我應該收到地址更新成功的通知
    Given the delivery status is "PENDING_SHIPMENT"
    When I request to update the delivery address
    And I provide a new valid address
    Then the system should update the delivery address
    And the logistics system should update the delivery order information
    And I should receive an address update success notification

  Scenario: Delivery failure - No one to sign
    # 假設配送狀態為 "配送中"
    # 當配送員到達配送地址
    # 並且無人簽收
    # 那麼配送員應該記錄配送失敗
    # 並且配送狀態應該更新為 "配送失敗"
    # 並且系統應該安排重新配送
    # 並且我應該收到配送失敗的通知
    # 並且通知應該包含重新配送的信息
    Given the delivery status is "IN_TRANSIT"

    And there is no one to sign for the delivery
    Then the delivery person should record the delivery failure
    And the delivery status should be updated to "DELIVERY_FAILED"
    And the system should arrange for redelivery
    And I should receive a delivery failure notification
    And the notification should include redelivery information
