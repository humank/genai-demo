Feature: Comprehensive Observability Integration
  As a DevOps engineer and SRE
  I want comprehensive end-to-end observability integration
  So that I can monitor, trace, and analyze the entire system across all environments

  Background:
    Given the observability system is fully configured
    And all monitoring components are healthy

  @observability @integration
  Scenario: End-to-end structured logging pipeline
    Given the application is running with structured logging enabled
    When a business operation is performed
    Then logs should be generated in JSON format with correlation IDs
    And logs should be forwarded to CloudWatch Logs
    And logs should be streamed to OpenSearch for real-time search
    And log lifecycle management should archive logs to S3 after 7 days
    And historical logs should be queryable through unified search interface

  @observability @metrics
  Scenario: Comprehensive metrics collection and monitoring
    Given the metrics collection system is active
    When business operations generate metrics
    Then Spring Boot Actuator should expose metrics endpoints
    And Prometheus should collect metrics from the application
    And CloudWatch Metrics should receive application and infrastructure metrics
    And Grafana dashboards should display real-time metrics
    And CloudWatch alarms should trigger for threshold violations

  @observability @tracing
  Scenario: Distributed tracing across all components
    Given distributed tracing is enabled across all services
    When a request flows through multiple components
    Then OpenTelemetry should generate unique trace IDs
    And trace context should be propagated across all service boundaries
    And AWS X-Ray should receive traces in production environment
    And Jaeger should receive traces in development environment
    And traces should correlate with logs and metrics using correlation IDs

  @observability @health
  Scenario: Health checks and automated alerting
    Given health monitoring is configured
    When system components are monitored
    Then Kubernetes liveness and readiness probes should validate application health
    And health endpoints should verify database connectivity and external services
    And CloudWatch custom metrics should reflect health status changes
    And SNS notifications should be sent for critical health issues
    And automated recovery procedures should be triggered for known issues

  @observability @analytics
  Scenario: Business intelligence and analytics pipeline
    Given the analytics pipeline is operational
    When domain events are published to MSK
    Then Kinesis Data Firehose should stream events to S3 data lake
    And AWS Glue should catalog the event data for analysis
    And QuickSight should provide real-time business dashboards
    And executive dashboards should show key business metrics
    And operational dashboards should display system performance metrics

  @observability @multi-environment
  Scenario: Multi-environment observability configuration
    Given the system supports multiple deployment environments
    When deployed in development environment
    Then lightweight observability stack should be used (H2, in-memory events, Jaeger)
    And local Prometheus and Grafana should be available
    When deployed in production environment
    Then full observability stack should be active (RDS, MSK, X-Ray, CloudWatch)
    And AWS managed services should handle observability data
    And cross-region observability replication should be enabled

  @observability @security
  Scenario: Security and compliance in observability
    Given security requirements are enforced
    When observability data is collected and transmitted
    Then PII information should be masked in logs and events
    And all data transmission should use TLS encryption
    And IAM roles should enforce least privilege access to observability tools
    And data retention policies should be automatically enforced
    And security events should be logged and monitored separately

  @observability @performance
  Scenario: Performance optimization and cost management
    Given cost optimization is enabled
    When observability data is generated at scale
    Then metrics sampling strategies should reduce collection overhead
    And log levels should be optimized based on environment
    And resource right-sizing should be applied based on actual usage
    And CloudWatch billing alerts should monitor observability costs
    And cost optimization recommendations should be generated automatically

  @observability @disaster-recovery
  Scenario: Multi-region observability and disaster recovery
    Given multi-region deployment is active
    When observability data is generated in primary region (Taiwan)
    Then data should be replicated to secondary region (Tokyo) in real-time
    And Route 53 health checks should monitor regional availability
    And automated failover should maintain observability during disasters
    And cross-region log aggregation should provide unified monitoring
    And disaster recovery procedures should be validated monthly

  @observability @cicd
  Scenario: CI/CD pipeline observability integration
    Given CI/CD pipeline is configured with observability
    When code changes are deployed through GitHub Actions and ArgoCD
    Then deployment metrics should be tracked and visualized
    And build quality gates should include observability validation
    And automated rollback should be triggered based on health metrics
    And deployment success/failure should be correlated with system metrics
    And GitOps deployment status should be monitored and alerted

  @observability @load-testing
  Scenario: Observability under load conditions
    Given the system is under high load
    When processing 1000+ concurrent requests
    Then observability overhead should remain under 5% of total system resources
    And trace sampling should maintain representative coverage
    And metrics collection should not impact application performance
    And log processing should handle high-volume scenarios without data loss
    And alerting should remain responsive during load spikes
    And system should auto-scale observability infrastructure based on demand
