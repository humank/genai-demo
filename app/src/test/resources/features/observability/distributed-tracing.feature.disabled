Feature: Distributed Tracing
  As a developer
  I want to trace requests across microservices
  So that I can understand request flow and identify bottlenecks

  Background:
    Given the distributed tracing system is enabled
    And the application is running with tracing configuration

  Scenario: Generate unique trace ID for incoming requests
    Given a client makes a request to the system
    When the request enters the system
    Then the system should generate a unique trace ID using OpenTelemetry
    And the trace ID should be included in the response headers
    And the trace ID should be propagated to all logs

  Scenario: Create spans for each operation
    Given a request is being processed
    When the request flows through different components
    Then the system should create spans for each operation
    And each span should have proper timing information
    And spans should be linked to the parent trace

  Scenario: Send traces to appropriate backend
    Given traces are being generated
    When running in development environment
    Then traces should be sent to Jaeger for analysis
    When running in production environment
    Then traces should be sent to AWS X-Ray for analysis

  Scenario: Show complete request journey
    Given a request has been processed completely
    When viewing traces in the tracing backend
    Then the system should show the complete request journey
    And timing information should be available for each span
    And the trace should include all components involved

  Scenario: Highlight failed spans with error details
    Given a request encounters an error during processing
    When the error occurs in a specific component
    Then the system should highlight the failed span
    And error details should be included in the span
    And the error should be propagated to the trace level

  Scenario: Correlate traces with logs and metrics
    Given a request is being traced
    When logs are generated during request processing
    Then logs should include the trace ID and span ID
    And correlation ID should be consistent across traces and logs
    And metrics should be tagged with trace context when available

  Scenario: Handle trace context propagation
    Given a request with existing trace context
    When the request is received by the system
    Then the existing trace context should be extracted
    And new spans should be created as children of the existing trace
    And trace context should be propagated to downstream services

  Scenario: Sample traces based on configuration
    Given the tracing system is configured with sampling
    When multiple requests are processed
    Then only the configured percentage of traces should be sampled
    And sampling decisions should be consistent across the trace
    And important traces should always be sampled regardless of sampling rate

  Scenario: Support different tracing backends per environment
    Given the application is deployed in different environments
    When running in development environment
    Then Jaeger should be used as the tracing backend
    When running in production environment
    Then AWS X-Ray should be used as the tracing backend
    And configuration should automatically select the appropriate backend

  Scenario: Maintain performance with tracing enabled
    Given the tracing system is enabled
    When processing high volumes of requests
    Then the application performance should not be significantly impacted
    And tracing overhead should be minimal
    And the system should remain responsive under load
