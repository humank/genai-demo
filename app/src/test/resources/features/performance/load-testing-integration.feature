Feature: Load Testing and Performance Validation
  As a performance engineer
  I want to validate system performance under various load conditions
  So that I can ensure the system meets performance requirements and scales appropriately

  Background:
    Given the system is deployed and operational
    And performance monitoring is active

  @performance @load-testing @baseline
  Scenario: Baseline performance validation
    Given the system is running under normal load
    When baseline performance tests are executed
    Then response times should be under 200ms for 95th percentile
    And throughput should support at least 100 requests per second
    And error rate should be less than 0.1%
    And resource utilization should be under 70% for CPU and memory
    And database query performance should meet defined SLAs
    And observability overhead should be less than 5% of total resources

  @performance @load-testing @stress
  Scenario: Stress testing under high load
    Given the system is configured for stress testing
    When load is gradually increased to 1000 concurrent users
    Then system should maintain response times under 2 seconds for 95th percentile
    And error rate should remain under 1%
    And auto-scaling should trigger additional instances as needed
    And database connections should scale appropriately
    And observability systems should continue to function normally
    And no memory leaks or resource exhaustion should occur

  @performance @load-testing @spike
  Scenario: Spike testing for sudden load increases
    Given the system is running under normal load
    When sudden spike of 500% load increase occurs
    Then system should handle the spike without complete failure
    And auto-scaling should respond within 2 minutes
    And circuit breakers should protect downstream services
    And graceful degradation should maintain core functionality
    And recovery should occur automatically when load decreases
    And monitoring should capture and alert on spike events

  @performance @load-testing @endurance
  Scenario: Endurance testing for sustained load
    Given the system is configured for endurance testing
    When sustained load is applied for 4 hours
    Then performance should remain stable throughout the test period
    And no performance degradation should occur over time
    And memory usage should remain stable without leaks
    And database performance should not degrade
    And log processing should handle sustained volume
    And system should recover normally after test completion

  @performance @load-testing @database
  Scenario: Database performance under load
    Given database performance monitoring is active
    When database load increases significantly
    Then query response times should remain within acceptable limits
    And connection pooling should handle concurrent connections efficiently
    And database CPU and memory utilization should remain stable
    And slow query detection should identify performance bottlenecks
    And read replicas should distribute read load effectively
    And backup operations should not impact performance significantly

  @performance @load-testing @observability
  Scenario: Observability system performance under load
    Given observability systems are monitoring application load
    When application generates high volume of logs, metrics, and traces
    Then log processing should handle volume without data loss
    And metrics collection should maintain accuracy under load
    And trace sampling should provide representative coverage
    And observability infrastructure should auto-scale with application load
    And monitoring dashboards should remain responsive
    And alerting should continue to function reliably

  @performance @load-testing @network
  Scenario: Network performance and bandwidth validation
    Given network monitoring is configured
    When network traffic increases due to load testing
    Then network latency should remain within acceptable limits
    And bandwidth utilization should be monitored and optimized
    And CDN should effectively cache and serve static content
    And load balancer should distribute traffic evenly
    And network security should not significantly impact performance
    And cross-region network performance should meet requirements

  @performance @load-testing @caching
  Scenario: Caching effectiveness under load
    Given caching layers are configured and monitored
    When load testing exercises cached and non-cached paths
    Then cache hit rates should meet defined targets (>80%)
    And cached responses should be significantly faster than non-cached
    And cache invalidation should work correctly under load
    And cache memory usage should remain within limits
    And cache performance should scale with application load
    And cache warming should be effective for critical data

  @performance @load-testing @api
  Scenario: API performance and rate limiting validation
    Given API endpoints are configured with rate limiting
    When API load testing is performed
    Then rate limiting should protect against abuse while allowing legitimate traffic
    And API response times should meet SLA requirements
    And API error handling should be graceful under load
    And API documentation should accurately reflect performance characteristics
    And API versioning should not impact performance significantly
    And API authentication should remain performant under load

  @performance @load-testing @frontend
  Scenario: Frontend performance under concurrent users
    Given frontend applications are deployed and monitored
    When multiple concurrent users access the frontend
    Then page load times should remain under 3 seconds
    And JavaScript execution should not block user interactions
    And API calls from frontend should be optimized and efficient
    And Static assets should be served efficiently through CDN
    And Progressive loading should improve perceived performance
    And Mobile performance should meet responsive design requirements

  @performance @load-testing @recovery
  Scenario: Performance recovery after load events
    Given the system has experienced high load conditions
    When load returns to normal levels
    Then system performance should return to baseline within 5 minutes
    And auto-scaling should scale down resources appropriately
    And resource utilization should return to normal levels
    And any temporary performance degradation should be resolved
    And system health checks should confirm full recovery
    And performance metrics should reflect successful recovery

  @performance @load-testing @cost
  Scenario: Cost optimization during performance testing
    Given cost monitoring is active during performance testing
    When load testing exercises various system components
    Then resource costs should scale proportionally with load
    And cost optimization recommendations should be generated
    And unused resources should be identified and flagged
    And cost per transaction should remain within acceptable limits
    And Reserved instance utilization should be optimized
    And Spot instance usage should be evaluated for cost savings
