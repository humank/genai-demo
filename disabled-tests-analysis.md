## Conclusion

The analysis reveals a systematic pattern of issues affecting 55 disabled tests, primarily centered around configuration conflicts, dependency issues, and resource constraints. The majority of these tests (80%+) can be reactivated through systematic resolution of the identified root causes, following the prioritized implementation plan outlined above.

The key to success will be implementing unified test configurations, resolving HTTP client dependencies, and optimizing resource management while maintaining clear documentation for any tests that must remain disabled due to environment-specific constraints.
