# Observability Architecture

## Overview

This document describes the comprehensive observability architecture for the GenAI Demo application, integrating logging, metrics, tracing, and business intelligence capabilities across development and production environments.

## Architecture Principles

### 1. Multi-Environment Strategy

- **Development**: Lightweight, local observability tools
- **Production**: Full AWS-native observability stack
- **Profile-based Configuration**: Automatic switching based on Spring profiles

### 2. Three Pillars of Observability

- **Logging**: Structured JSON logs with correlation IDs
- **Metrics**: Application and business metrics via Prometheus/CloudWatch
- **Tracing**: Distributed tracing with OpenTelemetry and AWS X-Ray

### 3. Event-Driven Analytics

- **Domain Events**: Business events streamed to analytics pipeline
- **Real-time Dashboards**: QuickSight dashboards for business insights
- **Cost Optimization**: Automated log archival and lifecycle management

## Component Architecture

    end

```

### Infrastructure Components

#### Development Environment

- **Local Prometheus**: Docker Compose setup for metrics collection

- **H2 Console**: Database inspection and debugging

#### Production Environment

- **CloudWatch Logs**: Centralized log aggregation
- **CloudWatch Metrics**: Long-term metrics storage
- **AWS X-Ray**: Distributed tracing across services
- **Amazon MSK**: Event streaming for analytics
- **OpenSearch Service**: Advanced log search and analysis
- **QuickSight**: Business intelligence dashboards

## Logging Strategy

### Log Structure

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:45.123Z",
  "level": "INFO",
  "thread": "http-nio-8080-exec-1",
  "logger": "solid.humank.genaidemo.application.order.OrderApplicationService",
  "message": "Order created successfully",
  "mdc": {
    "correlationId": "abc-123-def",
    "userId": "CUST-001",
    "orderId": "ORDER-456",
    "traceId": "1-5e1b4e5f-38a7c5c3f5a1b2c3d4e5f6a7",
    "spanId": "38a7c5c3f5a1b2c3"
  },
  "kubernetes": {
    "pod": "genai-demo-7d4b8c9f8-xyz12",
    "namespace": "default",
    "node": "ip-10-0-1-100.ap-northeast-1.compute.internal"
  }
}
```

### Log Lifecycle Management

1. **Real-time (0-7 days)**: CloudWatch Logs for immediate access
2. **Warm storage (7-30 days)**: S3 Standard for cost optimization
3. **Cold storage (30+ days)**: S3 Glacier for long-term retention
4. **Search capability**: OpenSearch Service for advanced queries

## Metrics Collection

### Application Metrics

- **Business Metrics**: Order count, revenue, customer registrations
- **Performance Metrics**: Response times, throughput, error rates
- **System Metrics**: JVM memory, CPU usage, database connections
- **Custom Metrics**: Domain-specific KPIs and SLAs

### Metrics Pipeline

```mermaid

    APP[Spring Boot App] -->|Micrometer| PROMETHEUS[Prometheus]
    PROMETHEUS -->|Remote Write| CLOUDWATCH[CloudWatch Metrics]
    PROMETHEUS -->|Query| GRAFANA[Grafana Dashboards]
    CLOUDWATCH -->|Alarms| SNS[SNS Notifications]
```

## Distributed Tracing

### Trace Context Propagation

- **OpenTelemetry**: Industry-standard tracing instrumentation
- **AWS X-Ray**: AWS-native tracing service
- **Correlation IDs**: MDC-based correlation across logs and traces
- **Span Attributes**: Rich metadata for trace analysis

### Trace Sampling Strategy

- **Development**: 100% sampling for complete visibility
- **Production**: Adaptive sampling based on traffic volume
- **Error Traces**: Always sample traces with errors
- **High-value Traces**: Always sample business-critical operations

## Event-Driven Analytics

### Domain Events Pipeline
