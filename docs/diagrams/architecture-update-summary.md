## Diagram Standards

### Mermaid Conventions

- **Color Coding**: Consistent color schemes across diagrams
- **Naming**: Clear, descriptive node names
- **Grouping**: Logical subgraph organization
- **Styling**: Consistent CSS classes for different component types

### Documentation Structure

- **Overview**: Brief description of the diagram purpose
- **Components**: Detailed explanation of each component
- **Relationships**: Description of connections and data flows
- **Implementation Notes**: Technical implementation details

## Validation Checklist

### For Each Updated Diagram
