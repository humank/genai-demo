# Excalidraw Concept Maps Collection

This document records four core concept maps generated using Excalidraw MCP, which provide high-level visual overviews of the system architecture.

## Concept Map List

### 1. Bounded Contexts Concept Map

**Purpose**: Show the main bounded contexts in the system and their relationships

**Content**:
- **Core Business Contexts**: Customer (Identity & Profile), Order (Transaction), Product (Catalog), Payment (Financial)
- **Supporting Contexts**: Inventory (Stock), Delivery (Logistics), Promotion (Marketing), Notification (Communication)
- **Relationship Arrows**: Show dependencies and data flow between contexts

**Features**:
- Use different colors to distinguish different types of contexts
- Clearly mark core business flow: Customer → Order → Product → Payment
- Show how supporting services interact with core business

### 2. User Journey Concept Map

**Purpose**: Visualize the complete flow of user interaction with the system

**Content**:
- **Starting Point**: Customer (ellipse, representing user)
- **Key Steps**: Browse → Select → Order → Payment → Delivery → Complete
- **Touchpoints**: Registration, product catalog, shopping cart, checkout, payment gateway, order tracking, delivery confirmation

**Features**:
- Use flow arrows to show the sequence of user journey
- Different colors represent the importance of different stages
- Clearly mark key touchpoints at each stage

### 3. System Architecture Concept

**Purpose**: Show the high-level structure of hexagonal architecture

**Content**:
- **Presentation Layer**: REST APIs, Web UI
- **Application Layer**: Use case implementation, service coordination
- **Domain Layer**: Business logic, entities
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Database, message queue, file storage
- **External Systems**: Payment gateway, email service, third-party APIs

**Features**:
- Clearly show the layered structure of hexagonal architecture
- Use arrows to show dependencies between layers
- Distinguish between internal architecture and external systems

### 4. Stakeholder Mapping

**Purpose**: Identify and visualize all system stakeholders and their concerns

**Content**:
- **Primary Stakeholders**: End Users (functionality), Business (requirements), Developers (implementation), Operations (deployment)
- **Secondary Stakeholders**: Architects (design), QA Team (quality), Security (compliance)
- **Central System**: All stakeholders are associated with the system

**Features**:
- Use ellipses to represent stakeholders, emphasizing their importance
- Connection lines show the relationship between each stakeholder and the system
- Different colors distinguish different types of stakeholders

## Technical Implementation

### Excalidraw MCP Features Used

1. **Batch Element Creation** (`mcp_excalidraw_batch_create_elements`)
   - Create multiple related elements at once
   - Improve creation efficiency
   - Ensure consistency between elements

2. **Single Element Creation** (`mcp_excalidraw_create_element`)
   - Create specific elements (arrows, text, etc.)
   - Precise control over element attributes
   - Support dynamic adjustments

3. **Element Query** (`mcp_excalidraw_query_elements`)
   - Check existing elements on canvas
   - Ensure no duplicate creation
   - Support element management

### Design Principles

1. **Color Consistency**
   - Use consistent color schemes for each type of concept
   - Blue series: Core business functions
   - Orange series: User interactions
   - Green series: Technical implementation
   - Purple series: Management and control

2. **Shape Semantics**
   - Rectangles: System components, process steps
   - Ellipses: Users, stakeholders
   - Arrows: Process direction, dependency relationships
   - Lines: Association relationships

3. **Layout Logic**
   - Left to right: Time sequence or process sequence
   - Top to bottom: Hierarchical structure or importance
   - Central radiation: Core concepts with related elements

## Usage Guidelines

### How to Read These Concept Maps

1. **Bounded Context Map**: Understand the business domain division of the system
2. **User Journey Map**: Learn how users interact with the system
3. **System Architecture Map**: Grasp the overall structure of technical architecture
4. **Stakeholder Map**: Identify all relevant stakeholders

### Maintenance and Updates

- Update corresponding concept maps when system requirements change
- Regularly check consistency between concept maps and actual implementation
- Use version control to track change history of concept maps
