## 🚀 Integration Results

### ✅ Optimization Achievements

- **File Count**: 8 files → **5 files** (37.5% reduction)
- **Duplicate Content**: Significantly reduced duplication in testing, architecture, and technology stack related content
- **Context Window**: Significantly reduced token usage for steering rules
- **Maintainability**: Centralized management, avoiding information fragmentation
