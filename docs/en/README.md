This is a demonstration project based on Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and Hexagonal Architecture, showcasing how to build a Java application with good architecture and testing practices.

## Project Architecture

This project adopts Hexagonal Architecture (also known as Ports and Adapters Architecture) and Domain-Driven Design, dividing the application into the following main layers:

1. **Domain Layer**
   - Contains core business logic and rules
   - Does not depend on other layers
   - Includes aggregate roots, entities, value objects, domain events, domain services, and domain exceptions

2. **Application Layer**
   - Coordinates domain objects to complete user use cases
   - Only depends on the domain layer
   - Contains application services, DTOs, command and query objects
   - Responsible for data transformation between interface layer and domain layer

3. **Infrastructure Layer**
   - Provides technical implementation
   - Depends on the domain layer, implementing interfaces defined by the domain layer
   - Contains repository implementations, external system adapters, ORM mappings, etc.
   - Organized by functionality into sub-packages like persistence and external systems

4. **Interface Layer**
   - Handles user interactions
   - Only depends on the application layer, not directly on the domain layer
   - Contains controllers, view models, request/response objects, etc.
   - Uses its own DTOs to interact with the application layer

## Architecture Testing

This project uses ArchUnit to ensure code follows predetermined architectural rules. Architecture tests are located in the `app/src/test/java/solid/humank/genaidemo/architecture/` directory, including:

1. **DddArchitectureTest** - Ensures compliance with DDD layered architecture
   - Ensures domain layer does not depend on other layers

### Testing Best Practices

Tests in this project follow these best practices:

- **3A Principle**: Each test has clear Arrange-Act-Assert structure
- **No Conditional Logic**: Tests do not contain if-else statements
- **Descriptive Naming**: Use clear test method names and @DisplayName
- **Test Independence**: Each test is independent and repeatable
- **DRY Principle**: Use test utility tools to avoid duplicate code

Run BDD tests:

```bash
./gradlew cucumber
```

Run specific types of tests:

```bash
# Run unit tests
./gradlew test --tests "*UnitTest*"

# Run integration tests
./gradlew test --tests "*IntegrationTest*"

# Run BDD tests
./gradlew test --tests "*BddTest*"
```

View Cucumber test reports:

```bash
./gradlew cucumber
# Then open app/build/reports/cucumber/cucumber-report.html
```

## UML Diagrams

This project uses PlantUML to generate various UML diagrams, including:

- Class diagrams, object diagrams, component diagrams, deployment diagrams
- Sequence diagrams (order processing, pricing processing, delivery processing), state diagrams, activity diagrams
- Domain model diagrams, hexagonal architecture diagrams, DDD layered architecture diagrams, event storming diagrams, etc.

Recently updated diagrams:

- **DDD Layered Architecture Diagram**: Shows dependency relationships and data flow between layers
- **Pricing Processing Sequence Diagram**: Shows the flow of pricing-related operations
- **Delivery Processing Sequence Diagram**: Shows the flow of delivery-related operations
- **Updated Domain Model Diagram**: Added pricing and delivery aggregates

See [UML Documentation](uml/README.md) for more information.

## Common Issues

### Configuration Cache Issues

If you encounter configuration cache-related errors, you can use the `--no-configuration-cache` parameter:

```bash
./gradlew --no-configuration-cache <task>
```

### Allure Report Issues

If Allure report generation fails, you can try:

1. Clean the project: `./gradlew clean`
2. Re-run tests and generate report: `./gradlew runAllTestsWithReport`

Allure reports automatically include all test results, including JUnit unit tests, architecture tests, and Cucumber BDD tests. Reports show test execution status, test steps, failure reasons, and related attachments.
