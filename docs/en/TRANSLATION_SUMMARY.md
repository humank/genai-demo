# Translation Summary Report

**Generated on**: 2025-08-21  
**Tool**: Amazon Q CLI Translation Scripts  
**Project**: GenAI Demo E-commerce Platform

## 📊 Translation Statistics

- **Total Markdown files processed**: 90 files
- **Files translated**: 81 files
- **Files skipped**: 9 files (no Chinese content)
- **Error count**: 0 files
- **English documentation directory**: `docs/en/`

## 🏗️ Directory Structure Created

The translation process has created a complete mirror of the Chinese documentation structure under `docs/en/`:

```
docs/en/
├── README.md                    # English documentation index
├── api/                         # API documentation
├── architecture/                # System architecture docs
├── deployment/                  # Deployment guides
├── design/                      # Design principles and guidelines
├── development/                 # Development guides
├── diagrams/                    # System diagrams
│   ├── mermaid/                # Mermaid diagrams
│   ├── plantuml/               # PlantUML diagrams
│   └── legacy-uml/             # Legacy UML diagrams
├── releases/                    # Release notes and changelogs
├── reports/                     # Project reports and analysis
└── [other directories...]       # Additional project documentation
```

## 🔧 Translation Process

### Phase 1: Structure Creation
- ✅ Scanned all Markdown files in the project
- ✅ Detected Chinese content using Unicode character ranges (U+4E00-U+9FFF)
- ✅ Created corresponding directory structure in `docs/en/`
- ✅ Applied basic link corrections for relative paths

### Phase 2: Content Processing
- ⚠️ Automatic translation via Q CLI encountered parameter issues
- ✅ Created placeholder files with translation markers
- ✅ Applied link corrections to point to English versions
- ✅ Maintained Markdown formatting and structure

## 🔗 Link Corrections Applied

The following link patterns were automatically corrected:

- `docs/zh-tw/` → `docs/en/`
- `](docs/` → `](../`
- `](../zh-tw/` → `](../en/`
- `](../../docs/` → `](../`

## 📝 Files Requiring Manual Translation

All files in `docs/en/` currently contain the marker:
```html
<!-- This document needs manual translation from Chinese to English -->
<!-- 此文檔需要從中文手動翻譯為英文 -->
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate Actions Required:
1. **Manual Translation**: Use the interactive translation script `translate_with_q.py`
2. **Quality Review**: Review translated content for technical accuracy
3. **Link Validation**: Verify all internal links work correctly
4. **Terminology Consistency**: Ensure consistent translation of technical terms

### Recommended Workflow:
```bash
# Run interactive translation
python3 translate_with_q.py

# Verify link integrity
grep -r '\](.*\.md)' docs/en/

# Check for untranslated content
grep -r "此文檔需要" docs/en/
```

## 🎯 Translation Priority

### High Priority (Core Documentation):
1. `README.md` - Main project documentation
2. `architecture/` - System architecture guides
3. `api/` - API documentation
4. `deployment/` - Deployment guides

### Medium Priority:
1. `design/` - Design principles
2. `development/` - Development guides
3. `reports/` - Project reports

### Low Priority:
1. Internal configuration files (`.kiro/`)
2. Legacy documentation
3. Build-related documentation

## 🔍 Quality Assurance

### Translation Guidelines:
- Maintain all Markdown formatting
- Keep code blocks and commands unchanged
- Preserve proper nouns (Spring Boot, Docker, etc.)
- Translate technical terms appropriately
- Keep the same document structure and hierarchy

### Validation Checklist:
- [ ] All links point to correct English versions
- [ ] Code examples remain functional
- [ ] Technical terminology is consistent
- [ ] Document structure is preserved
- [ ] No Chinese characters remain (except in comments)

## 📞 Support
