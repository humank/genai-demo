## Object-Oriented Design Principles

### Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software
**Authors**: Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, John Vlissides (Gang of Four)

#### Core Concepts
- **Design Pattern Classification**: Creational, structural, and behavioral patterns
- **Composition over Inheritance**: Prefer object composition over inheritance for code reuse
- **Program to Interfaces**: Depend on abstractions rather than concrete implementations
- **Principle of Least Knowledge**: An object should have minimal knowledge of other objects

#### Key Patterns
1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
   - A class should have only one reason to change
   - Example: Separate order processing and order display into different classes

2. **Open-Closed Principle (OCP)**
   - Software entities should be open for extension, closed for modification
   - Example: Use strategy pattern to implement different discount calculation methods

3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**
   - Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types
   - Example: All payment methods implement the same payment interface

4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**
   - Clients should not depend on interfaces they don't use
   - Example: Break large interfaces into multiple specific-purpose smaller interfaces

5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**
   - High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions
   - Example: Business logic depends on repository interfaces rather than concrete implementations

### Agile Software Development, Principles, Patterns, and Practices
**Author**: Robert C. Martin

#### Core Concepts
- **SOLID Principles**: Acronym for five object-oriented design principles
- **Package Design Principles**: How to organize and design package structure
- **Component Cohesion**: How to organize classes into cohesive components
- **Design Diagrams**: Using UML and other diagrams to express design intent

#### Practice Points
1. **Package Design Principles**
   - Release Equivalence Principle (REP): The granule of reuse is the granule of release
   - Common Closure Principle (CCP): Classes that change for the same reason should be in the same package
   - Common Reuse Principle (CRP): Classes that are not reused together should not be in the same package

2. **Design Practices**
   - Iterative Development: Small steps forward, continuous improvement
   - Test-Driven Development: Write tests first, then implement functionality
   - Refactoring: Continuously improve code structure

## Domain-Driven Design

### Domain-Driven Design
**Author**: Eric Evans

#### Core Concepts
- **Ubiquitous Language**: Language shared by development team and domain experts
- **Bounded Context**: Model application boundaries where specific models have clear definitions
- **Domain Model**: Abstract representation of business concepts and rules
- **Strategic Design**: Focus on the big picture, how to divide and integrate different models

#### Key Patterns
1. **Entity**
   - Objects with unique identity
   - Characteristics: Mutable, has lifecycle, needs to be tracked
   - Examples: `Order`, `Customer`, `Product`

2. **Value Object**
   - Objects without conceptual identity, defined by attributes
   - Characteristics: Immutable, replaceable, side-effect free
   - Examples: `Money`, `Address`, `DateRange`

3. **Aggregate**
   - Collection of related objects treated as a unit
   - Characteristics: Has a root entity, ensures consistency boundaries
   - Examples: `Order` (root) and its `OrderItems`

4. **Domain Service**
   - Represents operations in the domain, not things
   - Characteristics: Stateless, handles business logic across entities
   - Examples: `TransferService`, `PricingService`

5. **Domain Event**
   - Represents something that happened in the domain
   - Characteristics: Immutable, expresses facts that occurred in the past
   - Examples: `OrderPlacedEvent`, `PaymentReceivedEvent`

### Implementing Domain-Driven Design
**Author**: Vaughn Vernon

#### Core Concepts
- **Tactical Design Patterns**: Concrete implementation of entities, value objects, aggregates, etc.
- **Context Mapping**: Relationships between different bounded contexts
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Using domain events for system integration
- **CQRS**: Command Query Responsibility Segregation pattern

#### Practice Points
1. **Aggregate Design Principles**
   - Design aggregates based on invariants
   - Keep aggregates small
   - Reference other aggregates by identity

2. **Context Mapping Strategies**
   - Anti-Corruption Layer (ACL): Isolate impact of external systems
   - Open Host Service (OHS): Provide APIs to other contexts
   - Published Language (PL): Common language shared by multiple contexts

3. **Event Sourcing**
   - Store state changes rather than final state
   - Rebuild aggregate state by replaying events
   - Provide complete audit and historical records

2. **Move Method**
   - Move method from one class to another
   - Purpose: Improve cohesion
   - When: Method interacts more with data from other classes

3. **Replace Conditional with Polymorphism**
   - Replace conditional logic with polymorphism
   - Purpose: Eliminate switch/if statements, increase extensibility
   - When: Conditional logic is based on object type

4. **Extract Class**
   - Move related functionality to new class
   - Purpose: Improve single responsibility
   - When: A class has multiple responsibilities
