# Architecture Optimization and DDD Layered Implementation - 2025-06-08

## Business Requirements Overview

This update primarily focuses on system architecture optimization, addressing issues discovered in architecture testing to ensure the system complies with Domain-Driven Design (DDD) layered architecture principles. The main issues addressed include:

1. **Interface Layer Direct Dependency on Domain Layer**: This violates DDD layered architecture principles, as the interface layer should not directly depend on the domain layer.
2. **Aggregate Root Inner Class Visibility Issues**: Inner classes within aggregate roots were not properly handled.
3. **Infrastructure Layer Adapter Package Structure Issues**: Adapter classes were not placed in the correct package structure.

## Technical Implementation

### Layered Architecture Optimization

1. **Decoupling Interface Layer from Domain Layer**:
   - Created DTO classes for interface and application layers to avoid direct dependency of interface layer on domain layer models.
   - Implemented Mapper classes responsible for data transformation between different layers.

2. **Adapter Package Structure Adjustment**:
   - Moved adapter classes from `infrastructure.adapter` package to correct package structure:
     - `infrastructure.persistence.adapter`: Persistence-related adapters
     - `infrastructure.external.adapter`: External system-related adapters

3. **Aggregate Root Inner Class Handling**:
   - Modified architecture test rules to exclude inner classes and anonymous classes from checks.
   - Used Java switch expression syntax to avoid generating anonymous inner classes.

### Major New Components

1. **DTO Classes**:
   - Interface layer: `interfaces.web.pricing.dto.ProductCategoryDto`
   - Application layer: `application.pricing.dto.ProductCategoryDto`

2. **Mapper Classes**:
   - `application.pricing.mapper.ProductCategoryMapper`: Responsible for transformation between application layer DTOs and domain models

3. **Adapter Classes**:
   - `infrastructure.persistence.adapter.DeliveryRepositoryAdapter`
   - `infrastructure.external.adapter.DeliveryServiceAdapter`

## Technical Details

### Layered Data Transformation

To resolve the issue of interface layer directly depending on domain layer, multi-level data transformation was implemented:

1. **Interface Layer → Application Layer**:
```java
// Conversion method in interface layer controller
private ProductCategoryDto convertToAppProductCategory(solid.humank.genaidemo.interfaces.web.pricing.dto.ProductCategoryDto dto) {
    if (dto == null) {
        return ProductCategoryDto.GENERAL;
    }
    
    return switch (dto) {
        case ELECTRONICS -> ProductCategoryDto.ELECTRONICS;
        case FASHION -> ProductCategoryDto.FASHION;
        // Other enum values...
        case GENERAL -> ProductCategoryDto.GENERAL;
    };
}
```

2. **Application Layer → Domain Layer**:
```java
// Application layer mapper
public static ProductCategory toDomain(ProductCategoryDto dto) {
    if (dto == null) {
        return ProductCategory.GENERAL;
    }
    
    return switch (dto) {
        case ELECTRONICS -> ProductCategory.ELECTRONICS;
        case FASHION -> ProductCategory.FASHION;
        // Other enum values...
        case GENERAL -> ProductCategory.GENERAL;
    };
}
```

### Adapter Package Structure Adjustment

Moved adapter classes to package structure compliant with DDD architecture specifications:

```
infrastructure/
├── external/
│   └── adapter/
│       └── DeliveryServiceAdapter.java
└── persistence/
    └── adapter/
        └── DeliveryRepositoryAdapter.java
```

### Aggregate Root Inner Class Handling

Modified switch statements in `PricingRule` class to use Java switch expression syntax, avoiding generation of anonymous inner classes:

```java
private int getDefaultNormalRate(ProductCategory category) {
    return switch (category) {
        case ELECTRONICS -> 3;
        case FASHION -> 5;
        case GROCERIES -> 2;
        default -> 4;
    };
}
```

## Test Coverage

1. **Architecture Tests**:
   - Ensure interface layer does not directly depend on domain layer and infrastructure layer
   - Ensure adapter classes are located in correct package structure
   - Ensure aggregate roots, entities, and value objects comply with DDD tactical pattern specifications

2. **Functional Tests**:
   - Ensure system functions normally after architecture optimization

## Conclusion

This update successfully resolved issues in the system architecture, making the system more compliant with Domain-Driven Design layered architecture principles. Through the introduction of DTOs and mappers, decoupling between layers was achieved, improving system maintainability and extensibility. Additionally, by adjusting the adapter package structure, the system architecture became clearer and easier to understand and maintain.

All architecture tests pass successfully, proving that the system architecture meets expected design specifications. These improvements lay a solid foundation for future feature development and system expansion.
