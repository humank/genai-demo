Based on the requirements in the product-pricing-promotion-rules.md file, I recommend creating the following new Bounded Contexts:

## Promotion Bounded Context

Responsible for handling all promotion rules and activities

Includes bundle sales, limited-time limited-quantity, member discounts, and other rules

Interacts with Order, Payment, Customer, and other Contexts

## Pricing Bounded Context

Responsible for price calculation logic

Applies various discount and promotional rules

Works closely with Promotion Context

## Customer/Member Bounded Context

Handles member information, points, and membership levels

Supports member-exclusive offers and birthday promotions

These new Bounded Contexts should establish clear relationships with existing Contexts:

- Promotion Context should be upstream of Order Context and Pricing Context, providing promotion rules
- Pricing Context should collaborate with Order Context and Payment Context to calculate final prices
- Customer/Member Context should collaborate with Promotion Context to provide membership qualification verification

Based on the requirements document and existing system structure, I believe we indeed need a Product/Catalog Bounded Context.

## Analysis Reasons:

The requirements document mentions product-related concepts multiple times:

- Product bundle sales ("Home Appliance Set")
- Product categories ("Category A")
- Product flash sales and limited quantity sales
- Add-on purchase products
- Gift products

These product-related concepts need a dedicated context to manage:

- Basic product information (name, description, images, etc.)
- Product categories and tags
- Product associations (e.g., bundled products, add-on products)
- Product inventory status (collaborating with Inventory Context)
- Product base prices (as input to Pricing Context)

The existing system seems to lack this context:

- Although there is an Inventory Context, it mainly focuses on inventory management
- No dedicated context for handling product catalogs and product information is visible

## Recommended Product/Catalog Bounded Context should:

- Serve as the authoritative source of product information
- Collaborate with Promotion Context to provide product category and association information
- Collaborate with Pricing Context to provide product base prices
- Collaborate with Inventory Context to associate product inventory status
- Collaborate with Order Context to provide detailed product information in orders

This context will be upstream of multiple other contexts, providing them with product-related foundational information, enabling promotion rules, price calculations, and other functions to operate correctly.
