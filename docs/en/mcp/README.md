## 🚀 Usage

### Basic Queries

```bash
# Time-related queries
"What time is it in Taipei now?"
"Convert UTC time to Taipei time"

# AWS documentation queries
"How to configure S3 bucket versioning?"
"What are the best practices for Lambda functions?"

# CDK development guidance
"Explain CDK Nag rule AwsSolutions-IAM4"
"How to implement security best practices in CDK?"

# Cost analysis
"Analyze the cost of this CDK project"
"What's the price of EC2 t3.medium in us-east-1?"

# GitHub operations
"List recent pull requests"
"Create a new issue"
```

### Advanced Features

#### Project Cost Analysis

MCP can analyze your CDK or Terraform projects and provide detailed cost assessments:

```bash
"Analyze current project AWS costs"
"Provide cost optimization recommendations"
"Compare prices across different AWS regions"
```

#### Architecture Decision Support

Combining AWS documentation and CDK best practices to provide architecture decision support:

```bash
"Recommend suitable AWS service architecture"
"Check if my CDK code follows best practices"
"Explain the use cases for this AWS service"
```

## ⚙️ Configuration Management

### Project Configuration (`.kiro/settings/mcp.json`)

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "time": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["mcp-server-time"],
      "disabled": false,
      "autoApprove": ["get_current_time", "convert_time"]
    },
    "aws-docs": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["awslabs.aws-documentation-mcp-server@latest"],
      "env": {"FASTMCP_LOG_LEVEL": "ERROR"},
      "disabled": false,
      "autoApprove": ["search_documentation", "read_documentation"]
    }
  }
}
```

### User Configuration (`~/.kiro/settings/mcp.json`)

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "github": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-proxy",
        "--transport", "streamablehttp",
        "--headers", "Authorization", "Bearer YOUR_TOKEN",
        "https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/"
      ],
      "disabled": false,
      "autoApprove": ["list_issues", "get_pull_request"]
    }
  }
}
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### MCP Server Connection Failure

1. Check network connectivity
2. Ensure `uv` and `uvx` are installed
3. Clear UV cache: `uv cache clean`
4. Restart Kiro IDE

#### Server Installation Stuck

Some MCP servers (like aws-core) may get stuck due to dependency issues:

```bash
# Clean stuck processes
pkill -f "uvx.*mcp"

# Clear UV cache
uv cache clean

# Reconfigure MCP servers
```

#### Performance Optimization

- Set `FASTMCP_LOG_LEVEL=ERROR` to reduce log output
- Use `autoApprove` to automatically approve common tools
- Regularly clean up unused servers

### Log Checking

View MCP logs in Kiro IDE:

1. Open command palette (Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + P)
2. Search for "MCP Logs"
3. Check connection status and error information

## 🛠️ Development and Extension

### Adding New MCP Server

1. Add server definition in configuration file
2. Configure necessary environment variables
3. Set up `autoApprove` list
4. Restart Kiro IDE

### Custom MCP Server

You can develop custom MCP servers to extend functionality:

```python
# Example: Custom MCP server
from mcp import Server
from mcp.types import Tool

server = Server("custom-server")

@server.tool()
def custom_function(param: str) -> str:
    return f"Processing result: {param}"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    server.run()
```
