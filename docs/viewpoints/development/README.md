# Development Viewpoint

## Overview

The Development Viewpoint provides comprehensive development guidelines and best practices, integrating all development patterns, technology stacks, and toolchains in the project. This viewpoint follows the Rozanski & Woods architecture methodology, providing unified development standards for developers, architects, and technical teams.

## Introduction

The Development Viewpoint is a core component of software architecture that defines how to build, test, and maintain high-quality software systems. This viewpoint covers the complete development lifecycle from code writing to deployment, ensuring teams can collaborate in a consistent and efficient manner.

## 🎯 SOLID Principles and Design Patterns

- [🎯 SOLID Principles and Design Patterns](solid-principles-and-design-patterns.md) - Complete SOLID principles and design patterns guide

### SOLID Principles
- 📏 Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) - A class should have only one reason to change
- 🔓 Open-Closed Principle (OCP) - Open for extension, closed for modification
- 🔄 Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) - Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types
- 🔌 Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) - Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they don't use
- 🔄 Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) - Depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations

### Design Patterns
- 🏭 Factory Pattern - Create objects without specifying their concrete classes
- 🔨 Builder Pattern - Construct complex objects step by step
- 📋 Strategy Pattern - Define a family of algorithms and make them interchangeable
- 👁️ Observer Pattern - Define one-to-many dependency between objects
- 🙈 Tell, Don't Ask - Tell objects what to do, don't ask for their state
