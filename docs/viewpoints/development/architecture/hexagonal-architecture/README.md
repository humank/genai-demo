# Hexagonal Architecture\n\n## Overview\n\nThis directory contains design principles and implementation guides for Hexagonal Architecture.\n\n## Hexagonal Architecture Principles\n\n### Core Concepts\n- **Domain Core** - The core of business logic, independent of external technologies\n- **Port** - Defines interfaces with the external world\n- **Adapter** - Concrete technical implementations of ports\n- **Dependency Inversion** - External depends on internal, not internal depends on external\n\n### Layer Structure\n```\ninterfaces/ → application/ → domain/ ← infrastructure/\n```\n\n### Implementation Guidelines\n- How to design ports and adapters\n- Best practices for dependency injection\n- Testing strategies and Mock usage\n- Integration with DDD\n\n## Related Documentation\n\n- Hexagonal Architecture\n- [Architecture Decision Record ADR-001](../../../../architecture/adr/ADR-001-ddd-hexagonal-architecture.md)\n- [Development Standards](../../../../../.kiro/steering/development-standards.md)\n\n---\n\n**Maintainer**: Development Team  \n**Last Updated**: January 21, 2025\n![Microservices Overview](../../../../diagrams/viewpoints/development/microservices-overview.puml)\n![Microservices Overview](../../../../diagrams/viewpoints/development/architecture/microservices-overview.mmd)"
