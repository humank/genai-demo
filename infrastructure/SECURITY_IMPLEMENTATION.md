- Encryption at rest and in transit
- Fine-grained access control

### 6. KMS Keys for Encryption at Rest

**Implementation:**

- Primary KMS key for general security encryption
- Dedicated KMS key for Secrets Manager

- Comprehensive key policies with least privilege access
- Service-specific permissions for CloudTrail, CloudWatch Logs

**Encryption Benefits:**

- Data encryption at rest
- Key lifecycle management
- Compliance with encryption requirements
- Centralized key management

### 7. Security Groups with Least Privilege Access

**Implementation:**

- Enhanced security group configurations in NetworkStack
- Principle of least privilege applied to all rules
- Service-specific security groups:
  - ALB Security Group (HTTP/HTTPS from internet)
  - EKS Security Group (internal communication)
  - RDS Security Group (database access from EKS only)
  - MSK Security Group (Kafka access from EKS only)

**Access Control Benefits:**

- Network-level security controls
- Reduced attack surface
- Service isolation
- Compliance with network security requirements

### 8. WAF (Web Application Firewall) for ALB Protection

**Implementation:**

- AWS Managed Rule Sets:
  - Common Rule Set (OWASP Top 10 protection)
  - Known Bad Inputs Rule Set
  - Linux Rule Set (OS-specific protection)
- Custom rate limiting rule (2000 requests per IP)
- CloudWatch metrics and logging enabled
- Automatic association with Application Load Balancer

**Web Security Benefits:**

- Protection against common web attacks
- DDoS mitigation through rate limiting
- Real-time threat blocking
- Compliance with web security standards

## Security Monitoring and Alerting

### CloudWatch Alarms

The SecurityStack implements comprehensive security monitoring with CloudWatch alarms for:

- Unauthorized API calls
- Console sign-in without MFA
- Root account usage
- IAM policy changes
- Security group modifications

### SNS Integration

All security events are routed to a dedicated SNS topic for:

- Real-time security notifications
- Integration with external security tools
- Escalation workflows
- Audit trail maintenance

## Compliance Features

### Data Retention Policies

- **Production Environment**: 7-year retention for compliance
- **Development Environment**: 1-year retention for cost optimization
- **Lifecycle Management**: Automatic transition to cheaper storage classes

### Audit Trail

- Complete API call logging via CloudTrail
- Configuration change tracking via AWS Config
- Network traffic logging via VPC Flow Logs
- Security event logging via GuardDuty

### Encryption Standards

- All data encrypted at rest using KMS
- All data encrypted in transit using TLS
- Key rotation enabled for all KMS keys
- Service-specific encryption keys for isolation

## Integration with Other Stacks

### NetworkStack Integration

- VPC Flow Logs configuration
- Enhanced security group rules
- Network-level security controls

### CoreInfrastructureStack Integration

- WAF association with Application Load Balancer
- SSL/TLS termination security
- Load balancer access logging

### Cross-Stack References

The SecurityStack provides the following resources for other stacks:

- KMS keys for encryption
- Security notification topics
- Audit log buckets
- Security compliance status

## Cost Optimization

### Storage Lifecycle Management

- Automatic transition to IA storage after 30 days
- Glacier storage for long-term retention
- Deep Archive for compliance data

### Environment-Specific Configurations

- Production: Enhanced security with longer retention
- Development: Cost-optimized with shorter retention
- Staging: Balanced approach for testing

## Deployment and Testing
