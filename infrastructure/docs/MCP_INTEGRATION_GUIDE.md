# MCP Integration and Well-Architected Framework Guide

## Overview

This guide provides comprehensive instructions for using AWS MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools to perform Well-Architected Framework reviews and continuous architecture improvements for the GenAI Demo project.

## MCP Tools Configuration

### Configured AWS MCP Servers

The following AWS MCP servers are configured in `.kiro/settings/mcp.json`:

| Server | Purpose | Auto-Approved Tools |
|--------|---------|-------------------|
| `aws-docs` | AWS Documentation access | `search_documentation`, `read_documentation` |
| `aws-cdk` | CDK guidance and analysis | `CDKGeneralGuidance`, `ExplainCDKNagRule`, `CheckCDKNagSuppressions` |
| `aws-pricing` | Cost analysis and optimization | `analyze_cdk_project`, `get_pricing`, `generate_cost_report` |
| `aws-iam` | IAM policy analysis | `list_users`, `list_roles`, `get_user_policies`, `get_role_policies` |
| `aws-core` | Well-Architected reviews | `prompt_understanding`, `well_architected_review` |

### Prerequisites

1. **UV Package Manager**: Install UV for Python package management

   ```bash
   # macOS
   brew install uv
   
   # Or using pip
   pip install uv
   ```

2. **AWS Credentials**: Configure AWS credentials for IAM and pricing tools

   ```bash
   aws configure --profile kim-sso
   export AWS_PROFILE=kim-sso
   export AWS_REGION=ap-northeast-1
   ```

3. **Kiro IDE**: Ensure Kiro IDE is properly configured with MCP support

## Well-Architected Framework Assessment

### Assessment Reports

The assessment generates three types of reports:

1. **Detailed Report**: `infrastructure/docs/well-architected-assessment.md`
   - Comprehensive analysis of all pillars
   - Best practices implemented
   - Risks identified
   - Detailed recommendations

2. **JSON Summary**: `infrastructure/docs/well-architected-summary.json`
   - Machine-readable assessment results
   - Suitable for automation and tracking

3. **Executive Summary**: `infrastructure/docs/executive-summary.md`
   - High-level overview for stakeholders
   - Key metrics and priorities
   - Action items with timelines

## MCP Tools Usage

### Testing MCP Integration

Verify that all MCP tools are properly configured:

```bash
cd infrastructure
npm run mcp:test
```

This test validates:

- MCP configuration file structure
- Required server configurations
- Auto-approval permissions
- AWS credentials setup

### Architecture Assessment with MCP

Run automated architecture assessment using MCP tools:

```bash
cd infrastructure
npm run architecture:assess
```

This assessment includes:

- CDK project analysis
- Cost optimization analysis using AWS Pricing MCP
- Security assessment using AWS IAM MCP
- Performance analysis
- Documentation analysis using AWS Docs MCP

### Continuous Improvement Monitoring

Monitor architecture improvements over time:

```bash
cd infrastructure
npm run monitoring:continuous
```

This monitoring system:

- Tracks metrics trends over time
- Generates improvement recommendations
- Triggers alerts for threshold violations
- Maintains historical performance data

## Using MCP Tools in Kiro IDE

### AWS Documentation MCP

Access AWS documentation directly in Kiro:

```
Ask Kiro: "Search AWS documentation for EKS best practices"
```

The AWS Documentation MCP will:

- Search official AWS documentation
- Provide relevant excerpts and links
- Offer implementation guidance

### AWS CDK MCP

Get CDK-specific guidance:

```
Ask Kiro: "Explain CDK Nag rule AwsSolutions-IAM4"
Ask Kiro: "Check my CDK code for Nag suppressions"
Ask Kiro: "Provide CDK best practices for security"
```

### AWS Pricing MCP

Analyze costs and optimize spending:

```
Ask Kiro: "Analyze my CDK project costs"
Ask Kiro: "Generate a cost report for my infrastructure"
Ask Kiro: "What are the pricing options for EKS in ap-northeast-1?"
```

### AWS IAM MCP

Review IAM policies and permissions:

```
Ask Kiro: "List all IAM roles in my account"
Ask Kiro: "Analyze the permissions for my EKS service role"
Ask Kiro: "Check for overprivileged IAM policies"
```

## Best Practices for MCP Usage

### 1. Regular Assessments

- **Weekly**: Quick MCP integration tests
- **Monthly**: Full architecture assessment
- **Quarterly**: Comprehensive Well-Architected review

### 2. Continuous Monitoring

- Set up automated monitoring with alerts
- Track improvement trends over time
- Review recommendations regularly

### 3. Documentation Maintenance

- Keep architecture decisions updated
- Document MCP tool usage patterns
- Maintain assessment history

### 4. Security Considerations

- Use readonly mode for IAM MCP
- Regularly rotate AWS credentials
- Monitor MCP tool access logs

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **MCP Server Not Found**

   ```bash
   # Ensure UV is installed and updated
   uv --version
   
   # Clear UV cache if needed
   uv cache clean
   ```

2. **AWS Credentials Issues**

   ```bash
   # Verify AWS credentials
   aws sts get-caller-identity --profile kim-sso
   
   # Check environment variables
   echo $AWS_PROFILE
   echo $AWS_REGION
   ```

3. **Permission Denied Errors**

   ```bash
   # Check IAM permissions for the configured profile
   aws iam get-user --profile kim-sso
   ```

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging for MCP tools:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "aws-docs": {
      "env": {
        "FASTMCP_LOG_LEVEL": "DEBUG"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Integration with CI/CD

### GitHub Actions Integration

Add MCP assessments to your CI/CD pipeline:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/architecture-assessment.yml
name: Architecture Assessment

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * 0'  # Weekly on Sunday
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  assess:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '18'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          cd infrastructure
          npm install
      - name: Run Well-Architected Assessment
        run: |
          cd infrastructure
          npm run well-architected:assessment
      - name: Upload Assessment Reports
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: architecture-assessment
          path: infrastructure/docs/
```

### Automated Alerts

Set up automated alerts for assessment results:

```bash
# Example: Send Slack notification for high-priority findings
if [ $(jq '.actionItems | map(select(.priority == "HIGH")) | length' infrastructure/docs/well-architected-summary.json) -gt 0 ]; then
  curl -X POST -H 'Content-type: application/json' \
    --data '{"text":"High priority architecture issues found. Check the assessment report."}' \
    $SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL
fi
```

## Metrics and KPIs

### Key Performance Indicators

Track these KPIs using MCP assessments:

| KPI | Target | Current | Trend |
|-----|--------|---------|-------|
| Overall Well-Architected Score | â‰¥85% | TBD | ðŸ“ˆ |
| Security Score | â‰¥90% | TBD | ðŸ“ˆ |
| Cost Optimization Score | â‰¥80% | TBD | ðŸ“ˆ |
| Performance Score | â‰¥85% | TBD | ðŸ“ˆ |
| Reliability Score | â‰¥90% | TBD | ðŸ“ˆ |
| Operational Excellence Score | â‰¥80% | TBD | ðŸ“ˆ |
| Sustainability Score | â‰¥70% | TBD | ðŸ“ˆ |

### Improvement Tracking

Use the continuous monitoring system to track improvements:

```bash
# Generate monthly improvement report
npm run monitoring:continuous

# View historical trends
cat infrastructure/docs/metrics-history.json | jq '.[] | {date: .timestamp, score: .overallScore}'
```

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Assessment Criteria

Extend the assessment framework with custom criteria:

```javascript
// infrastructure/scripts/custom-assessment.js
class CustomAssessment extends WellArchitectedAssessment {
  async assessCustomCriteria() {
    // Add your custom assessment logic
    const customScore = this.evaluateCustomRequirements();
    this.assessmentResults.pillars.custom = {
      score: customScore,
      findings: ['Custom assessment completed'],
      recommendations: ['Implement custom improvements']
    };
  }
}
```

### Integration with External Tools

Integrate MCP assessments with external monitoring tools:

```bash
# Export metrics to Prometheus
curl -X POST http://prometheus-pushgateway:9091/metrics/job/architecture-assessment \
  -d "well_architected_score $(jq '.overallScore' infrastructure/docs/well-architected-summary.json)"
```
