#### Risks Identified


#### Recommendations



## Priority Action Items


### Cost Optimization (MEDIUM Priority)

- Implement comprehensive cost monitoring
- Optimize data storage and compute costs


### Operational Excellence (MEDIUM Priority)

- Implement automated operational procedures
- Enhance monitoring and alerting capabilities


## Continuous Improvement

This assessment should be repeated quarterly to track improvements and identify new optimization opportunities. The following areas should be monitored continuously:

1. **Security Posture**: Regular security reviews and penetration testing
2. **Cost Optimization**: Monthly cost reviews and optimization opportunities
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Continuous performance metrics and optimization
4. **Operational Excellence**: Regular review of automation and processes
5. **Reliability Testing**: Quarterly disaster recovery testing
6. **Sustainability Metrics**: Energy efficiency and carbon footprint tracking

## Next Steps

1. Address HIGH priority action items within 30 days
2. Address MEDIUM priority action items within 90 days
3. Schedule quarterly Well-Architected reviews
4. Implement continuous monitoring for all pillars
5. Update architecture documentation based on findings
