  - `docs/viewpoints/concurrency/README.md` - Concurrency viewpoint overview
  - `docs/viewpoints/deployment/README.md` - Deployment viewpoint overview
- **Fixed References**: Resolved 29 stale references identified in functional viewpoint

### 3. Diagram File Verification ✅
- **Verified All Referenced Diagrams**:
  - `bounded-contexts-concept.png` (407KB) ✅
  - `bounded-contexts-overview.png` (632KB) ✅
  - `event-storming-big-picture.png` (452KB) ✅
  - `event-storming-process-level.png` (315KB) ✅
  - `business-process-flows.png` (452KB) ✅
  - `user-journey-overview.png` (115KB) ✅

### 4. Content Quality Assessment 📊
- **Overall Quality Score**: 71.7/100 (Grade C - Satisfactory)

- **Issues Identified**: 49 (mainly readability and completeness)

## Diagram References in New File

The newly created `bounded-contexts.md` file includes 6 diagram references:

1. **Bounded Contexts Concept** - Comprehensive overview of all 13 contexts
2. **Bounded Contexts Overview** - High-level context relationships
3. **Event Storming Big Picture** - Event-driven communication patterns
4. **Event Storming Process Level** - Detailed process flows
5. **Business Process Flows** - E-commerce core processes
6. **User Journey Overview** - Customer interaction patterns

## Mermaid Diagrams

The file also includes 2 inline Mermaid diagrams:
- **Bounded Context Architecture Diagram** - Visual context grouping
- **Core Dependencies** - Inter-context relationships

## Quality Improvements Made

### Fixed Broken Links
- Resolved references to missing concurrency and deployment viewpoint README files
- Created comprehensive English documentation for missing viewpoints
- Maintained consistency with existing documentation structure

### Enhanced Navigation
- All cross-references between viewpoints now work correctly
- Improved discoverability of related documentation
- Maintained proper link hierarchy

## Compliance Status

### ✅ Diagram Generation Standards
- PNG format used for GitHub documentation (primary format)
- All referenced diagrams exist and are accessible
- File sizes are reasonable for web display

### ✅ English Documentation Standards
- New README files created in English
- Maintained professional technical writing style
- Consistent terminology across viewpoints

### ✅ Architecture Documentation
- Proper viewpoint cross-references maintained
- DDD concepts properly documented
- Business context clearly explained

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

### Future Improvements
1. **Content Quality**: Address readability issues identified in quality assessment
2. **Documentation Completeness**: Add missing sections (usage examples, introductions)
3. **Regular Maintenance**: Schedule quarterly diagram synchronization checks

## Metrics

- **Execution Time**: ~2 minutes
- **Files Created**: 2 new README files
- **Links Fixed**: 29 stale references resolved
- **Diagrams Verified**: 6 PNG files confirmed accessible
- **Quality Score**: 71.7/100 (satisfactory for functional documentation)

## Conclusion

The diagram synchronization process completed successfully. All diagram references in the newly created bounded contexts documentation are functional and properly linked. The documentation structure is now consistent across all viewpoints with proper English README files in place.

**Status**: ✅ Complete
